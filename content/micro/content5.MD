Processing of Thoughts location

"I like to think that after dying someone such as Mother Thereasa will be experiencing the same kind of afterlife as a person like Adolf Hitler, or that guy that tried to kill Donald... Sounds fair, note to self, need to acquire more medication to block out these crazy concepts that are displayed over and over again from atom to star. If i burn my hand in a small region, a small region will be in pain, the larger or more severe the burn, the larger the resulting pain. The more gas i put in a fire, the higher that fire burns. Cause and Effect, so when does the universe even up, for when I make someone feel bad, it makes me feel so good? Ok, no longer believing in the universe either."
