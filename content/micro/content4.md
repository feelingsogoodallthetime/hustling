"And 2nd thing, just stop believing in any sort of higher power. I had more questions but he was late for a trump rally. I wonder.. if I say that i dont believe in taxes, does someone still collect that money from me when the time comes? Probably not, great advice and will have me with a much brighter outlook on stuff. Cuz i just stopped beliving in a moral compass, god, judgement, sin, right, wrong ... I just believe in science now. Thinking again, i am super full of myself because of how super smart I am. I just am not smart in the ways that allow you to legally make lots of money in ways that if(which there definately is NOT) there were some higher force, wouldnt be viewed in a similar fashion to the nazi's.
