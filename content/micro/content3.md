Processing of Thoughts location

"Was looking back on recent life events and started thinking about the terrible things i am injecting into this world. And then about if there was someone who had designed our reality, how witty i was being. With some voice screaming at me 'WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING, STOP BEING SUCH A FUCKING TERRIBLE PERSON", it makes me wonder if maybe doing this to people is somehow "wrong"? I went over this with a colleuge. He said that first thing is that you should never think about that stuff."
