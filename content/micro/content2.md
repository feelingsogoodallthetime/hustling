Processing of Thoughts location


"Was looking back on recent life events and started thinking about the terrible things i am injecting into this world.  And then about if there was someone who had designed our reality, how witty i was being.  With some voice screaming at me 'WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING, STOP BEING SUCH A FUCKING TERRIBLE PERSON", it makes me wonder if maybe doing this to people is somehow "wrong"?  I went over this with a colleuge.  He said that first thing is that you should never think about that stuff.  And 2nd thing, just stop believing in any sort of higher power.  I had more questions but he was late for a trump rally.  I wonder..  if I say that i dont believe in taxes, does someone still collect that money from me when the time comes?  Probably not, great advice and will have me with a much brighter outlook on stuff.  Cuz i just stopped beliving in a moral compass, god, judgement, sin, right, wrong ...   I just believe in science now.  Thinking again, i am super full of myself because of how super smart I am.  I just am not smart in the ways that allow you to legally make lots of money in ways that if(which there definately is NOT) there were some higher force, wouldnt be viewed in a similar fashion to the nazi's.  I like to think that after dying someone such as Mother Thereasa will be experiencing the same kind of afterlife as a person like Adolf Hitler, or that guy that tried to kill Donald...  Sounds fair, note to self, need to acquire more medication to block out these crazy concepts that are displayed over and over again from atom to star.  If i burn my hand in a small region, a small region will be in pain, the larger or more severe the burn, the larger the resulting pain.  The more gas i put in a fire, the higher that fire burns.  Cause and Effect, so when does the universe even up, for when I make someone feel bad, it makes me feel so good?  Ok, no longer believing in the universe either."
